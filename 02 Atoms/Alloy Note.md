# Summary - 
An **Alloy** note represents the final, publishable output of your synthesized knowledge and original thinking.

# Content -

An **Alloy** note represents the final, publishable output of your synthesized knowledge and original thinking.

• **Definition and Purpose**: Alloys are **publishable notes** or **original works** that you create by combining multiple Molecules (and Atoms). They are the "Express" component of the CODE method.

• **Content**: The content of an Alloy varies greatly depending on its intended output, such as social media posts, newsletters, YouTube videos, articles, or even academic papers and books. An Alloy typically starts by addressing a problem and then threads together various concepts, insights, and solutions derived from your Molecules and Atoms.

• **Role in Workflow**: Alloys are built from Molecules, which themselves are built from Atoms that were mined from Sources. They represent the "fruit" of your cultivated knowledge and can be published even if they are only partially complete, promoting a "learning in public" approach.

• **Characteristics**: An Alloy captures your **unique insights, original ideas**, and the meaningful connections you've made between different pieces of knowledge. The process of creating an Alloy often involves filling in any gaps between your existing Molecules to form a coherent, publishable narrative.

• **Analogy**: Alloys are likened to combining "Lego blocks" (Molecules) into specific, structured creations, allowing for limitless combinations and new publications.

**Key Differences Between Source and Alloy**

The fundamental difference lies in their **purpose** and their **position within the knowledge workflow**:

• **Purpose**: A **Source** is about **capturing and ingesting external information** that you consume. An **Alloy** is about **expressing and publishing your synthesized, original knowledge** and insights.

• **Content Origin**: A **Source** contains information that originates from **external mediums** (books, videos, etc.). An **Alloy** contains **your own unique ideas, insights, and connections** derived from processing those external sources through Atoms and Molecules.

• **Stage in Workflow**: A **Source** is at the **beginning** of the workflow, as part of the "Capture" phase. An **Alloy** is at the **end** of the workflow, representing the final "Express" phase or output.

• **Relationship to Atoms and Molecules**: **Atoms are mined from Sources**. **Alloys are built from Molecules** (which are in turn derived from Atoms and your own insights).
