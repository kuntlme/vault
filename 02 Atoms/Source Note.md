# Summary -
A **Source** is about **capturing and ingesting external information** that you consume. 

# Content -

A **source note** is a type of note created in Obsidian (or other personal knowledge management systems) to record information you consume from external media such as books, textbooks, online courses, podcasts, or YouTube videos. It serves as a central point of reference for a particular information source.

Here's a breakdown of what a source note is in simple terms:

- **Purpose as a Pointer**: A source note's main goal is to tell you **what is inside the source** and to store **pointers** to the original content, rather than repeating all its contents. This helps you quickly remember where information came from and where to find more details if needed.
- **Key Elements**: Typically, a source note includes:
    - A **brief summary** of the source's core thesis or main argument, often reduced to just a few bullet points.
    - Mentions of **key concepts** discussed in the source.
    - A **reference link** to the original source material, such as a book, website, or a citation manager like Zotero, for citation purposes.
    - Sections for **your own ideas, thoughts, and insights** that emerge while consuming the source, allowing you to separate your original thinking from external information.
    - **Tags**, such as `#Source` or `#book`, to categorize and easily retrieve all your source notes.
- **Relationship with "Atoms"**: A crucial aspect of source notes, particularly in the Molecular Notes system, is that they **do not explain concepts in detail**. Instead, detailed explanations of individual concepts (like the Efficient Markets Hypothesis) are extracted into separate, atomic notes called "**Atoms**". Multiple source notes can then link to the same Atom, which helps prevent duplication of information.
- **Fleeting Nature and Organization**: Source notes are considered a form of "fleeting note" in some systems, representing the initial capture phase of information. They can be automatically organized into a dedicated "sources" folder using plugins, streamlining your vault's structure.
- **Flexibility**: While guidelines exist for structuring source notes (e.g., using nested bullets for different levels of abstraction), the system emphasizes simplicity and flexibility to adapt to your personal needs and learning style.
