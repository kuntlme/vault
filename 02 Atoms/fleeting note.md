A **fleeting note** is a **quick, temporary note** you take to **capture initial thoughts, ideas, or information** as they first come to you.



Here's a simple breakdown:

- **Purpose**: Its main job is to **quickly jot down anything** so you don't forget it.
- **Temporary**: Fleeting notes are **not meant to be permanent**. You're supposed to process them later and convert them into more structured notes, like "Atoms" or "Molecules".
- **Informal**: You don't need to worry about perfect formatting when creating them.
- **Examples**:
    - **Source notes**: Notes taken while consuming external media like books or videos.
    - **Daily notes**: A "dumping ground" for daily ideas, tasks, or journal entries.
    - **New blank notes**: For new ideas when you don't have time to categorize them properly.
    - **Project notes**: Initial ideas for a specific project.

In essence, fleeting notes are the **raw material** that you later refine into more organized knowledge.
