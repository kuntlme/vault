A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.

The person himself will think of the real reason. You don't need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.

You make the person that you consider them honest, upright and fair.

## Priciple 10:

Appeal to the nobler motives.
