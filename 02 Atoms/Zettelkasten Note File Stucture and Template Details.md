## Summary:

This note is about how [[Zettelkasten]] note file stucture used to take notes.

# Content:
The file structure you should follow for taking notes within the Molecular Zettelkasten system in Obsidian involves both how your different note types are organized within your vault (e.g., in folders) and the consistent internal structure (template) of each note file. This system is designed to help you capture, organize, distill, and express your knowledge effectively.
Overall File Organization
The Molecular Zettelkasten system leverages folders, tags, and topic notes for organization. While tags can act as an alternative to folders, using both can provide a robust structure.

1. Folders: You can use specific folders to categorize your note types. An auto-note mover plugin can automate the process of moving new notes into their appropriate folders based on the tags you assign them. Recommended folders include:
   ◦ Sources: For raw information and literature notes from books, articles, videos, etc..
   ◦ Fleeting Notes: For quick thoughts and daily notes that are later processed.
   ◦ Atoms: For individual, distilled concepts explained in your own words.
   ◦ Molecules: For crystallized insights and connections between Atoms.
2. Tags: Tags are used extensively for categorization and to identify the type of note. Key tags include:
   ◦ #source: For source notes.
   ◦ #daily note: For daily fleeting notes.
   ◦ #atom: For atomic concept notes.
   ◦ #molecule: For insights and linked concept notes.
   ◦ #alloy: For publishable notes (often implied by the content's purpose).
   ◦ #topic: For broader conceptual notes that organize related ideas.
   ◦ #idea: For general fleeting thoughts or ideas.
   ◦ #book: For specific book sources.
3. Topic Notes: These are notes (tagged #topic) that serve as organizational hubs or "maps of content" for broader concepts like "Psychology" or "Personal Knowledge Management". They help introduce emergent structure and allow you to find all notes linked to a particular concept by clicking into the topic note.
   Template Structure for Note Types
   Each note type has a specific template to ensure consistency, aid in distillation, and facilitate future use. These templates define the key structural elements within each file:
   • Source Note Template: These are a form of fleeting notes for capturing information directly from external media.
   ◦ Tag: #source.
   ◦ Reference Link: A link to the original source (e.g., book, article, video, website) for citation and easy access.
   ◦ Topics: Related hash topic tags for categorization.
   ◦ Content Sections:
   ▪ Summary: A brief overview of the source.
   ▪ Key Takeaway: The most important points.
   ▪ Notes: Where you capture quotes, ideas, and observations as you consume the source. You might include chapter-specific notes for books.
   • Daily Note Template: Another type of fleeting note for jotting down daily thoughts.
   ◦ Tag: #daily note.
   ◦ Content Sections:
   ▪ Tasks: For daily to-dos.
   ▪ Ideas: A dumping ground for fleeting thoughts (often tagged #idea).
   ▪ Favorite Moments: For personal reflections.
   ▪ Journal: For daily journaling entries.
   • Atom Template: Represents a singular, existing concept, technique, formula, framework, historical event, or figure, translated into your own words. It's akin to a literature note or an atomic literature note.
   ◦ Tag: #atom.
   ◦ Page Number/Timestamp: References the specific location in the source.
   ◦ Reference Link: A link to the specific source from which the information was extracted.
   ◦ Topics: Related hash topic tags.
   ◦ Content (Body): The core idea or concept, translated into your own words (known as the "generation effect"). It should be brief, capturing only aspects relevant to your thinking. This could include definitions, principles, mental models, or historical facts.
   ◦ Citation: The source of the knowledge, often via the reference link.
   ◦ Alias (Optional): An alternative name for the concept (e.g., "Pareto Principle" also known as "80/20 Rule").
   • Molecule Template: Represents a crystallized insight, intuition, or connection between Atoms. It's similar to a permanent note or Zettel.
   ◦ Tag: #molecule.
   ◦ Topics: Related hash topic tags.
   ◦ Content (Body): Insights, ideas, or connections between Atoms. It often "builds on" one or more Atoms, should be self-contained and discrete (a couple of sentences to a paragraph at most), and is written as if for print or publication. This note type typically removes the direct page number and reference link as it synthesizes information beyond a single source.
   ◦ No Orphan Notes: Molecules should always be connected to other notes to generate note sequences and facilitate emergent properties.
   • Alloy Template: Represents a publishable note or "note sequence," serving as the "Express" component of the CODE method. Its structure is highly flexible based on the intended output.
   ◦ YAML Header (Optional): Can include properties like CSS class: dashboard, banner, or DG publish for specific display or publishing functions.
   ◦ Content (Body): Threads together multiple Molecules and Atoms into a cohesive narrative, often using Obsidian's embed function (!) to pull in content and graphics from existing notes. The final step involves filling in the gaps between embedded concepts to create seamless transitions and comprehensive explanations.
   By consistently following this structure, you create a dynamic, interconnected knowledge base that supports learning, idea generation, and effective communication.
