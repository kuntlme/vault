## The secret of Socrates

- Never start by discussing thing that you diffect.
  Never let people to say "NO" at beginning.
  Get the other person saying "Yes Yes"

NOTE: The next time we tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, lets's remember old Socrates( a great phylosopher ) and ask a gentle question - a question that will get the "yes, yes" response.

## Principle 5:

> Get the other person saying
> "yes, yes" immediately.
