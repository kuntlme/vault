- A feature vector is an **ordered list of scalar values**, with each value being called an **attribute** or **feature**.

### Goal

> The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to use the dataset to produce a model  
> that takes a feature vector x as input and outputs information that allows deducing the label  
> for this feature vector. For instance, the model created using the dataset of people could  
> take as input a feature vector describing a person and output a probability that the person  
> has cancer.
