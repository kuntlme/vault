Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughtshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats.
Lets remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful necessity of discharging or reprimanding an employee.

Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face.

 I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man is his dignity is a crime.

### Principle:
Let the other person save face.# Content -
