Based on the Molecular Zettelkasten system in Obsidian, as described in the sources and our conversation, here is a list of which note types should be kept in which folders:

*   **Source Notes:** These should be kept in the **`Sources` folder**.
    *   Source notes are used for capturing information directly from external media like books, articles, online courses, podcasts, and videos.
    *   They are consistently tagged with `#source`.
    *   The `auto-note mover plugin` can be configured to automatically move any note tagged with `#source` into the `Sources` folder.

*   **Daily Notes:** These should be kept in the **`Fleeting Notes` folder**.
    *   Daily notes are a type of fleeting note, used for quickly jotting down thoughts, ideas, tasks, and observations.
    *   They are tagged with `#daily note`.
    *   The `auto-note mover plugin` can automatically move notes with the `#daily note` tag into the `Fleeting Notes` folder.

*   **New Blank Notes (General Fleeting Notes):** These should also be kept in the **`Fleeting Notes` folder**.
    *   When you have a new idea not tied to a specific source or daily entry, you can quickly jot it down in a new blank note.
    *   These can be tagged with `#fleeting note` to facilitate sorting later into a "fleeting note inbox".
    *   The `auto-note mover plugin` can organize these into the `Fleeting Notes` folder.

*   **Atom Notes (Literature Notes):** These should be kept in an **`Atoms` folder**.
    *   Atoms represent existing concepts, techniques, formulas, or historical events, explained in your own words.
    *   They are consistently tagged with `#atom`.
    *   Creating a dedicated `Atoms` folder is part of the system's practice of creating a folder for each "note Primitive".
    *   The `auto-note mover plugin` can automatically move notes with the `#atom` tag into the `Atoms` folder.

*   **Molecule Notes (Permanent Notes):** These should be kept in a **`Molecules` folder**.
    *   Molecules represent crystallized insights, pieces of intuition, or connections between Atoms and your own ideas.
    *   They are consistently tagged with `#molecule`.
    *   Having a dedicated `Molecules` folder allows for easy exploration of "permanent notes".
    *   The `auto-note mover plugin` can automatically move notes with the `#molecule` tag into the `Molecules` folder.

*   **Alloy Notes (Publishable Notes):** These should be kept in an **`Alloys` folder**.
    *   Alloys are note sequences formed from molecules, designed for public expression (e.g., newsletters, YouTube videos, digital garden, articles).
    *   They are consistently tagged with `#alloy`.
    *   Creating a dedicated `Alloys` folder aligns with the strategy of organizing different note primitives into their own folders.
    *   The `auto-note mover plugin` can automatically move notes with the `#alloy` tag into the `Alloys` folder.

*   **Topic Notes:** These should be kept in a **`Topics` folder**.
    *   Topic notes are used for organizing with emergence, providing a semantic element to categorize related concepts.
    *   They are tagged with `#topic`.
    *   While tags offer an alternative to folders, having a dedicated `Topics` folder is an option for organization within the system.

This folder structure, combined with consistent tagging and the optional use of an `auto-note mover plugin`, helps to maintain a clear and organized knowledge base, allowing you to focus on connecting ideas rather than managing file locations.
