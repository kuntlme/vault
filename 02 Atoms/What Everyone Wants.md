Magic phrase that stop argument, eliminate your feeling create good will
" I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I had you I would underwear feel just as you do"

You deserve very little credit for being what you are and remember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pity them. Sympathize with them.

Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.

## Principal 9:
Be sympathetic with the other
person's idea and desires.
