# My thoughts - 

This note is maintained with the concept of [[Code]]
use [[Source Template]] as a template to create [[Source Note]].
To use book source page we use [[Book Source Template]] as a template.

- Note taking Tiers:
    - Separating my thoughts from [[Source Note]]
- In source note there have three parts [[summary]], key takeaways and note

    - MAIN LEVEL: current concept of ducussion, heading, or a title
        - quote + page number or timestamp -> [[external note]]
            - MY IDEAS, thoughts, and insights -> [[internal note]]

- Daily Note
    - in idea section we can use #idea
    - also we can use #fleetingnote for [[fleeting note]]

here we use [[Generation Effect]] to use [[Zettelkasten]] - is means use own words to express the topic.

Distill is a own-working process mean learn by doing.
Distill is the main part of [[Zettelkasten]] system.

Ex - in time of watching podcast I write a [[fleeting note]] then I work throw the note and write note in my own word using [[Generation Effect]].

## Atom notes

I use Atom note using [[Atom (Literature Note) Template]].

- Here have Quotes, Concepts, Key Takeways
- Convert the Quotes into our own words
  EACH ATOM NOTE HAVE ONE SINGULAR IDEA OR CONCEPT
  Example atom note - [[Atom Note Example]].
  "If you want to learn something, you write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words."

## Molecule Notes

I use [[Molecule (Parmanent Note) Template]] template for molecule notes
Example: [[Molecule Note Example]].

## Alloy Notes
An **Alloy** is about **expressing and publishing your synthesized, original knowledge** and insights. Read [[Alloy Note]] for more about alloy.

## Difference of [[Alloy Note]] and [[Source Note]] -
[[Alloy Note]] is the final note that are publishabe. 
And the [[Source Note]] is the entry point note that collect the external source for any note. Basically it is a entry point to take note.

# External Source - 
also for better understanding [[Zettelkasten Note File Stucture and Template Details]]
and for deciding which note go to which folder [[Which Note should go which Folder]].
