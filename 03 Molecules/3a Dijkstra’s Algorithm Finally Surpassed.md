Dijkstra’s Algorithm Finally Surpassed !

For almost 𝟳𝟬 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀, Dijkstra’s algorithm has been the gold standard for finding the 𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘭𝘦-𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘤𝘦 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘱𝘢𝘵𝘩.

The legend goes that in 1956, Edsger W. Dijkstra devised it in 𝟮𝟬 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗲—a simple, elegant solution that became one of computer science’s most celebrated algorithms.

But now, a team of researchers — Ran Duan, Jiayi Mao, Xiao Mao, Xinkai Shu, and Longhui Yin — has achieved what was long thought impossible: they’ve 𝗯𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 “𝘀𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗿”.  
🔹 𝗗𝗶𝗷𝗸𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮’𝘀 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: O(m + n log n) (where sorting is the bottleneck)  
🔹 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵: O(m · log^(2/3) n) — a deterministic algorithm that beats the log n barrier for the first time.

How did they do it? Instead of relying on classical priority queues, the researchers designed a 𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 that avoids the overhead of traditional sorting. Their approach redefines how shortest-path relaxations can be scheduled and processed, combining graph decomposition with new priority bucketing strategies.

This isn’t just a technicality — it’s a 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘨𝘮 𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘧𝘵. For decades, textbooks suggested Dijkstra’s bound was the “final word.” Today, that boundary has been crossed.

☕ Dijkstra’s 20-minute coffee idea may finally have a worthy successor — one that took the theory community nearly 𝟳 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗮𝗱𝗲𝘀 to brew.
