## 🧘‍♀️ Great for Weekly or Deeper Reflection
*Use these for a weekly review or when you have more time for a deep dive into your life, values, and patterns.*

- [ ] Am I taking enough risks in my life? How would I like to change my relationship with risk?
- [ ] In what ways am I currently self-sabotaging or holding myself back?
- [ ] Consider and reflect on what might be my “favorite failure.”
- [ ] How do the opinions of others affect me? Is this something I want to change?
- [ ] What is a boundary that I need to draw or reinforce in my life right now?
- [ ] What did I learn from my last relationship? (If you haven’t had one, what could you learn from a relationship that you’ve observed?)
- [ ] What is a view about the world that has changed for me as I’ve gotten older?
- [ ] React to this quote: 
  > "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.” — Anaïs Nin
- [ ] React to this quote:
  > “Do you think it is better to fail at something worthwhile, or to succeed at something meaningless?” — Tommy Wallach
