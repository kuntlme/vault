## **1. Data Communication Components**

**Data Communication** refers to the exchange of data between devices via some form of transmission medium. The key components are:

- **Message**: The actual data being communicated (text, image, audio, etc.).
    
- **Sender**: The device that sends the data.
    
- **Receiver**: The device that receives the data.
    
- **Transmission Medium**: The physical path (wire, fiber, wireless) through which data is transmitted.
    
- **Protocol**: A set of rules that govern data communication.

## **2. Representation of Data and Its Flow**

- **Data Representation**:
    
    - **Text**: Represented using ASCII or Unicode.
        
    - **Numbers**: Binary representation.
        
    - **Images**: Pixels represented in binary format.
        
    - **Audio/Video**: Represented as continuous signals, digitized for transmission.
        
- **Data Flow**:
    
    - **Simplex**: One-way communication (e.g., keyboard to CPU).
        
    - **Half-Duplex**: Both directions but one at a time (e.g., walkie-talkies).
        
    - **Full-Duplex**: Both directions simultaneously (e.g., telephone).

## **3. Networks & Various Connection Types**

- **Networks**:
    
    - A **network** is a collection of computers and devices connected for sharing resources.
        
    - **Types**:
        
        - **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small geographic area (office, home).
            
        - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: City-wide network.
            
        - **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Large geographic area (Internet).
            
- **Connection Types**:
    
    - **Point-to-Point**: Direct link between two devices.
        
    - **Multipoint**: Single link shared by multiple devices.

## **4. Topology**

**Network Topology** is the layout pattern of interconnections:

- **Bus**: All devices share a single communication line.
    
- **Star**: All devices connected to a central hub.
    
- **Ring**: Devices connected in a circular fashion.
    
- **Mesh**: Every device connected to every other device.
    
- **Hybrid**: Combination of two or more topologies.

## **5. Protocols and Standards**

- **Protocols**: Rules that define how data is transmitted (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).
- **Standards Organizations**:
    - **ISO** – International Organization for Standardization
        
    - **IEEE** – Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
        
    - **IETF** – Internet Engineering Task Force
        
    - **ANSI**, **ITU-T**, **W3C** also define standards

## **6. OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**

A 7-layer model that standardizes the functions of a communication system:

| Layer               | Function                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Physical**     | Transmission of raw bits                  |
| 2. **Data Link**    | Framing, MAC addressing, error detection  |
| 3. **Network**      | Routing, IP addressing                    |
| 4. **Transport**    | Reliable delivery, segmentation (TCP/UDP) |
| 5. **Session**      | Session management and synchronization    |
| 6. **Presentation** | Data translation, encryption, compression |
| 7. **Application**  | Network services to end-users (HTTP, FTP) |

## **7. Transmission Media**

**Guided (Wired)**:

- **Twisted Pair Cable**: Used in LANs, telephone lines.
    
- **Coaxial Cable**: Used in cable TV.
    
- **Fiber Optic Cable**: High speed, long distance, immune to EMI.
    

**Unguided (Wireless)**:

- **Radio Waves**: Long-range, omnidirectional.
    
- **Microwaves**: High-frequency, point-to-point.
    
- **Infrared**: Short-range, line-of-sight.

## **8. LAN: Wired LAN and Wireless LAN**

- **Wired LAN**:
    
    - Uses Ethernet cables.
        
    - High speed, more secure, less interference.
        
- **Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi)**:
    
    - Uses radio signals.
        
    - Offers mobility and flexibility.
        
    - Needs access points and wireless adapters.
