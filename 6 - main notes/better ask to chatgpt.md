Absolutely! Asking better questions is a **skill that separates average users from the top 1%** because it directly affects the quality and depth of answers you get. Based on your usage and patterns, here’s a breakdown of **5 ways to improve your questions** and **where the gaps might be**:

---

### **1. Add Specific Context Instead of Only the Problem**

- **Top 1% Users Do:**  
    They provide **clear context**, including:
    
    - **What they already tried**
        
    - **Expected vs. actual output**
        
    - **Environment details** (OS, version, dependencies)
        
    - **Why they are asking** (goal or end use case)
        
- **Your Current Gap:**  
    Many of your coding or tech questions start with the error or the “how to” but **don’t include prior attempts or reasoning**.  
    _Example:_ You might ask, _“how to pull a branch in another branch?”_  
    **Better:**  
    _“I have `main` and `feature/login` branches in Git. I want to bring changes from `feature/auth` into `feature/login` without merging into main yet. Should I rebase or merge, and why?”_  
    → This gives context and helps me give an **exact workflow**.

### **2. Define Your Goal or Outcome**

- **Top 1% Users Do:**  
    They **clarify the end goal**, not just the step they’re stuck on. This allows me to suggest **better or alternative solutions**.  
    Example: Instead of _“How do I fix this Next.js error?”_, they ask:  
    _“I want to dynamically load Google profile images in Next.js using `next/image` without errors. The current error is `hostname not configured`. What’s the correct way to fix this and allow these URLs?”_
    
- **Your Current Gap:**  
    Sometimes you focus **only on the immediate error** without stating the bigger picture. This limits answers to “quick fixes” instead of **best practices**.
    

---

### **3. Show a Minimal Example**

- **Top 1% Users Do:**  
    For coding or technical questions, they provide **Minimal Reproducible Examples (MREs)**:
    
    - A short snippet of the code
        
    - Steps to reproduce the error
        
    - Stripped of irrelevant parts
        
- **Your Current Gap:**  
    Your code snippets are often **partial or missing the setup/environment**.  
    Example: You share the **line with the error**, but not the **full context** like function imports or the environment (Node version, DB used).  
    **Better:** Provide a **runnable snippet or pseudo-MRE** so I can debug **like I’m in your project**.

### **4. Ask for Explanation, Not Just an Answer**

- **Top 1% Users Do:**  
    They often say:  
    _“Explain why this approach works”_ or  
    _“What’s the difference between A and B in this context?”_  
    This encourages **deep learning**, not just patching problems.
    
- **Your Current Gap:**  
    Many of your questions are **solution-focused** rather than **understanding-focused**, which limits growth.  
    Example:  
    _Current style:_ “What does `revalidate` do in Next.js?”  
    _Better:_ “What does `revalidate` do in Next.js 15? Could you compare it with Incremental Static Regeneration and give an example use case?”  
    → This invites a **clear explanation + example**.
    

---

### **5. Structure Your Question for Quick Parsing**

- **Top 1% Users Do:**  
    They format their questions in a **readable, step-by-step way**:
    
    - Brief problem summary (1–2 lines)
        
    - What they tried
        
    - Error/log/output
        
    - Exact question or goal
        
- **Your Current Gap:**  
    Some of your questions are **long single-paragraph dumps** or **very short single-line queries**. This makes it harder to **quickly parse and prioritize info**.
    
    **Example – Your current:**  
    _“docker daemon not connecting”_
    
    **Top 1% style:**
    
    ```
    Problem: Docker daemon not connecting to Desktop on Ubuntu
    Tried:
    1. Restarted Docker service
    2. Checked /var/run/docker.sock permissions
    Error: 
    "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///home/coderk/.docker/desktop/docker.sock"
    Question: 
    How do I correctly point Docker CLI to this socket on Ubuntu?
    ```
    
    → This is **structured and gets a better answer faster**.

### **Summary of Gaps vs. Top 1%**

|Area|Top 1% Users|Your Current Pattern|
|---|---|---|
|**Context**|Detailed|Often missing environment & prior attempts|
|**Goal Definition**|Clear end goal|Focus on immediate fix|
|**Examples**|Minimal reproducible|Partial or missing|
|**Understanding**|Ask for explanation|Solution-only focus|
|**Structure**|Step-by-step|Sometimes one-line or scattered|
