# Mind Management: Boosting Productivity

**tags:** #prodactivity

To effectively manage your work and boost productivity, it is crucial to understand two key frameworks: the **Four Stages of Creativity** and the **Seven Mental States of Clarity**. This approach is referred to as **"mind management,"** which the author suggests is more effective than "time management," as all work is done with the mind.

## Four Stages of Creativity

Understanding these stages can significantly enhance your productivity and lead to better long-term results.

1. **Preparation**  
   This is the **learning period** where you should conduct as much research as possible on your current subject.  
   > Example: Author Steven Covey spent 10 years reading motivational books before writing *"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."*

2. **Incubation**  
   This stage involves **taking breaks**.  
   > Example: Yuval Noah Harari, author of *"Sapiens,"* takes two-month breaks annually to disconnect and meditate.

3. **Illumination**  
   This is when **ideas suddenly emerge**, often while doing mundane tasks.  
   > Example: A scientist might get a breakthrough idea while traveling or doing something repetitive.

4. **Verification**  
   In this final stage, you **verify your idea, work, or thought**, either by yourself or with others.  
   > Example: Cross-checking a financial report or having it reviewed by a senior.

## Seven Mental States of Clarity

The author states that everyone is always in one of these seven mental states. Knowing your current state and aligning your work accordingly can significantly improve productivity.

1. **Priority Mental Stage**  
   Focus on prioritizing your thoughts by asking:
   - *What do I need to do?* (Direction)
   - *How can I get this work done?* (Velocity)
   - *What should I not do?* (Filtering distractions)

2. **Explore Stage**  
   **Explore your priorities** to determine which tasks are worth pursuing.

3. **Research Stage**  
   **Gather information** through learning and discovery. This stage doesn’t require deep mental effort.

4. **Generate Stage**  
   After research, **create output** — write, film, build, design.

5. **Polish Stage**  
   **Refine and improve** your work. Step back and take a high-level view to enhance quality.

6. **Administer Stage**  
   **Detach from creative work**. Organize, document, and handle systems or spend time with family.

7. **Recharge Stage**  
   **Take a break to rejuvenate** — vacation, rest, or time in nature.

> ⚠️ Align tasks with your current mental state for optimal performance. For example, don't force creative work when your mind is in an administrative or recharge state.

## Bonus: Parkinson's Law

**Parkinson’s Law**:  
> "Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."

- If you give yourself a month to complete a task, it will likely take the full month.
- If you set a one-week deadline, your brain will adapt and find ways to complete it faster.

This law highlights the importance of setting time limits to boost productivity.
