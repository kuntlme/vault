_Perfect for a quick, daily practice to process your day and ground yourself in the present._

- [ ] What are some small things that other people have done that really made my day?
- [ ] What frustrated me today? Can I find any core values of mine that explain why it bugs me so much?
- [ ] What is one thing I need to give myself more credit for today?
- [ ] What is holding me back from being productive at the moment? What is one small thing I can do about that?
- [ ] If the tears I cried recently could talk, what would they say?
- [ ] What thought, worry, or feeling from today can I choose to let go of before I sleep?
- [ ] Write about something (or someone) that is currently tempting me. What's the deeper need behind this temptation?
